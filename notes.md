# Python quick notes #

## Regular expressions ##

All functionality is included in:

```python
import re
```

Perhaps the simplest way to use a regular expression is to find all instances of
a thing and replace them with another thing.

The following snippet compresses all of the whitespace characters in a string 
into single spaces. This is a good way to condense things, or to remove 
unexpectedly malicious mystery characters.

```python
myString = complicatedStringWithWhitespacesGalore

myString = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', myString)
```

Let's break that down:

-   `r'\s+'` is the regular expression. In this case it means find any group of 
    at least one whitespace character. We need the `r` because backslashes mean
    different things in regexes than in Python, and that notation tells the 
    interpreter to treat everything in the quotes as literal characters.
    
-   `' '` is just the single space to substitute for what we find.

=   `myString` is the string to search.
